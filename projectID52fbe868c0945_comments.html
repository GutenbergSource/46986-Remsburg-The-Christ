<HTML><BODY>The next infidel work by John E. Remsburg we can tackle is his work on The Christ, which is highly critical of the core figure in Christianity, and even disputes his historicity. Also builds on the work by Drews which is going through PGDP at about this time.

<p>Again not a very hard book to proof.

<p>Scans are available from the Internet Archive, and a text copy has been available from the <a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/rmsbrg00.htm">Positive Atheism</a> site for years. I propose to proofread it here again to have a clean edition, but will let it skip P3, as I can use this version as a double check.
